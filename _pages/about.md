I received the BS degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2023, where I am currently working towards the PhD degree under the supervision of associate professor Sheng Zhang. He is a member of the State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology. My research interests include edge computing and video analytics.
